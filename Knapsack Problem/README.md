This project shows three different approcahes to solve the knapsack problem. The three approaches include brute forcing the problem (Time efficiency of n2^n and Space efficiency of 2^n), dynamic programming (Time efficiency of O(n*max_weight_of_knapsack) and space efficiency of O(n*max_weight_of_knapsack)), and lastly the ratio method (Time efficiency of O(nlogn) and space efficiency of 1).

To examine and run knapsack.py:

1) Load it into your choice of IDE
2) Have a plaintext file titled "input" in the directory the code is running from.
2.5) If your plaintext file with points is titled differently, the "open" statement in the code can be edited to your plaintext's name.
3) Select to run the program
4) The terminal will not ask for any information.
5) The program will output information in the terminal and exit by itself.
