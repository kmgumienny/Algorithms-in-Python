This project uses an O(nLogn) function to go through a list of points and find the shortest distance between any of the points in the list.

To examine and run closestp.py:

1) Load it into your choice of IDE
2) Have a plaintext file titled "input" in the directory the code is running from. An example of the format is: [(0, 0),(7, 6),(2, 20),(12, 5),(16, 16), (5, 8),(19, 7),(14, 22),(8, 19),(7,29), (10, 11),(1, 13)]
2.5) If your plaintext file with points is titled differently, the "open" statement in the code can be edited to your plaintext's name.
3) Select to run the program
4) The terminal will not ask for any information.
5) The program will output information in the terminal and exit by itself.
